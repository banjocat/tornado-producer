# Python tornado practice project to different databases

Like all my practice projects I setup goals that I try to reach

## Goals
* Use tornado to accept JSON and write to target storage
* Use docker
* JSON to cassandra
* JSON to kafka
* JSON to postgresql
* JSON to mongodb
* JSON to couchdb
* JSON to elastic search
* JSON to rabbitmq


## Extra goals - depends on how long the above takes
* Benchmark them all and then write document on why benchmark can't be trusted
* Compare using tornado async libraries vers python3 concurrent
