# Python tornado practice project

The purpose of this project is to experiment with tornado
and also learn general python api connections to popular databases.

## Goals
* Use tornado to accept JSON and write to target storage
* Use docker
* JSON to cassandra
* ~~JSON to kafka~~
* JSON to postgresql
* ~~JSON to mongodb~~
* JSON to couchdb
* JSON to elastic search
* JSON to rabbitmq
* Visualization software of all of the above(if it exists)
* Make all at least concurrent.. but determine which can be async and not.. and why


## Extra goals - depends on how long the above takes
* ~~Compare using tornado async libraries vers python3 concurrent~~
